## Purpose of this guide

This document details instructions on how to quickly get up and running with a local demo deployment of the
REMS Integration Prototype environment. This is primarily meant for non-technical users interested in exploring the
prototype on their own machine with minimal setup.

_Note:_ If you are looking to contribute or make code changes, please see the full
[Developer Environment Setup](DeveloperSetupGuide.md).

_Note:_ If you are looking to just have more control or configuration options with Docker in your local environment, see
[the configurable install](#docker-compose-without-porter).

## Components

The following REMS components will be deployed in Docker locally:

1. [test-ehr](https://github.com/mcode/test-ehr)
2. [request-generator](https://github.com/mcode/request-generator)
3. [rems-admin](https://github.com/mcode/rems-admin.git)
4. [rems-setup](https://github.com/mcode/rems-setup.git)
5. [pims (Pharmacy Information Management System)](https://github.com/mcode/pims)
6. [rems-smart-on-fhir](https://github.com/mcode/rems-smart-on-fhir)
7. [rems-intermediary](https://github.com/mcode/rems-intermediary.git)
8. [rems-directory](https://github.com/mcode/rems-directory.git)

## Quick Setup

### 1. System Requirements

See [this section](DeveloperSetupGuide.md/#minimum-system-requirements) from the developer setup guide for more information. Most computers will meet the minimum requirements.

### 2. Run

1. [Install git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).
2. Use git to clone or download and extract the zip of the [rems-setup repository](https://github.com/mcode/rems-setup.git).
3. In your terminal, navigate to the rems-setup directory.

   ```bash
   cd rems-setup
   ```

4. Start Docker Compose application

   ```bash
   cd rems-setup # Need to execute commands in directory with corresponding docker-compose.yml file located in the REMS repository
   docker compose up
   ```

   Note, if you are using an M1/M2 mac, you'll need to prepend `docker compose` commands with
   `COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/arm64`.

   ```bash
   cd rems-setup # Need to execute commands in directory with corresponding docker-compose.yml file located in the REMS repository
   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 docker compose up
   ```

### 3. Verify everything is working

See [this guide](Verify-REMS-Integration-Prototype-Works.md) to generate a test request.

## Cleanup and Useful Options

### Obtain [Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/) API key

The UMLS Value Set Authority Center provides several value sets that the REMS SMART app uses to automatically fill out forms using information from the patient record. Providing a VSAC API key is optional, but will enable this feature. 

See [this section](DeveloperSetupGuide.md/#obtain-value-set-authority-center-vsac-api-key) from the developer setup guide for more information on obtaining an API key.

Once an API key is obtained, see the following section for information on how to use it.

### Set Environment Variables

Set up your local environment with your VSAC credentials (`VSAC_API_KEY`) and Docker Compose project name (`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`). You can accomplish this easily by modifying the `.env` file in this repository.

See the [setting environment variables section](#setting-environment-variables) for more information.

Note: How you set environment and path variables may vary depending on your operating system and terminal used.


### Remove the Docker Compose containers to free up resources

```bash
docker compose down
```

or if on M1/M2 Mac use

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-m1.yml down
```

### Cleanup Docker resources

To remove all images, volumes, and artifacts set up during the install, run the following commands

```bash
docker image prune -a
docker volume prune
docker network prune
```

### Updating Docker Compose application images

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache --pull [<service_name1> <service_name2> ...]
docker compose --force-recreate  [<service_name1> <service_name2> ...]
# Options:
#   --force-recreate                        Recreate containers even if their configuration and image haven't changed.
#   --build                                 Build images before starting containers.
#   --pull                                  Pull published images before building images.
#   --no-cache                              Do not use cache when building the image.
#   [<service_name1> <service_name2> ...]   Services to recreate, not specifying any service will rebuild and recreate all services
```

### Running with SSL

See the documentation [here](SSLSetupGuide.md).
