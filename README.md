[HTTPS / SSL Setup Guide](SSLSetupGuide.md) - Follow this guide to launch each application in the prototype workflow with SSL enabled.

## Running end-to-end tests

We use Playwright for end-to-end testing, which automates running the full prototype environment.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run all tests: `npx playwright test` or with the `-ui` flag to view them in the Chromium browser.
